/*
 * Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the leaders in the array.
 *  An element of array is leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side.
 *   The rightmost element is always a leader. 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2}
Output: 17 5 2
Explanation: The first leader is 17 
as it is greater than all the elements
to its right.  Similarly, the next 
leader is 5. The right most element 
is always a leader so it is also 
included.
